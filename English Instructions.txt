# 🚀 Tutorial: AI Stem Separation in REAPER

This tutorial will teach you how to split any song into **6 independent tracks** (Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, and Other) directly inside REAPER, for free and locally.

## 1. Prerequisites (Only done once)

Before using the script, your computer needs to have the AI “engine” installed and properly configured.

### **Install Python:**

* Download and install **Python 3.10 or 3.11** from [python.org]().
* **Important:** During installation, check the box that says **“Add Python to PATH.”**

### **Install FFmpeg (Critical):**

* This is the "translator" the AI uses to read and write audio files.
* **Windows:** Download FFmpeg and add it to your System PATH variables.
* **Mac:** Open your terminal and run `brew install ffmpeg`.

### **Install Demucs & Dependencies:**

Open your system terminal (Windows: `cmd`, Mac: `Terminal`) and run this specific command to avoid common errors:
`pip install demucs soundfile==0.12.1 "torchaudio<2.5.0"`

> **Note:** If you get an error about "TorchCodec", running the command above will fix it.

### **Configure REAPER:**

1. Open REAPER and go to **Options > Preferences > Plug-ins > ReaScript**.
2. Check the box **“Enable Python for use in ReaScripts.”**
3. If REAPER asks for the Python DLL path, it usually detects it automatically after restarting the program.

## 2. Script Installation

1. Download the file `AI_Stem_Splitter_by_Oliver_Tkach.lua`.
2. In **REAPER**:
* Open the **Action List** by pressing the `?` key (or go to **Actions > Show action list**).
* Click the **New action** button (bottom right) and select **Load ReaScript...**
* Find and select the downloaded `.lua` file.

## 3. Add the Command to the Right-Click Menu (Context Menu)

To make it easy to use, let’s add it to the menu that appears when you right-click an audio item:

1. Go to the top menu: **Options > Customize menus/toolbars...**
2. In the dropdown at the top left, select: **Media item context**
3. In the list on the left, scroll to the bottom.
4. Click **Add... > Action...**
5. Search for “AI_Stem_Splitter_by_Oliver_Tkach” in the list, select it, and click **Select/Close**.
6. **(Optional)** Right-click the newly added action and choose **Rename** to give it an epic name like: “SPLIT STEMS” or “AI STEM SPLITTER.”
7. **IMPORTANT:** Click the **Save** button (bottom right) to apply the changes.

## 4. How to Use It

1. **Save your project first!** (Especially on Mac to avoid permission errors).
2. Drag a song or audio clip into REAPER.
3. Right-click on the audio item.
4. Select your new option (e.g., **SPLIT STEMS**).
5. A black window (CMD) will open. **Do not close it.**
* *First time:* It will download 2GB of AI models.
* *After that:* Wait until it reaches 100% and closes automatically.


6. REAPER will automatically import the 6 aligned tracks, organized inside a folder.

## 🛡️ Security & Performance Notes

* **100% Private:** The process is fully local. Your music is not uploaded to the internet.
* **Clean Workflow:** The script uses your system’s temporary folder to avoid leaving unnecessary files on your hard drive.
* **GPU vs CPU:** * **NVIDIA Users:** The script uses CUDA to process in seconds.
* **Others (Mac/AMD/Intel):** It uses the CPU. It has the same professional quality but takes 3-7 minutes per song.


* **Mac Users:** If you get a "Destination error", go to *System Settings > Privacy > Full Disk Access* and enable REAPER.

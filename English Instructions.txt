Aquí tienes el tutorial actualizado. He integrado las soluciones técnicas críticas (FFmpeg, las librerías específicas y los permisos de Mac) manteniendo toda tu estructura original y el tono instructivo.

🚀 Tutorial: AI Stem Separation in REAPER
This tutorial will teach you how to split any song into 6 independent tracks (Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, and Other) directly inside REAPER, for free and locally.

1. Prerequisites (Only done once)
Before using the script, your computer needs to have the AI “engine” installed and properly configured.

Install Python:
Download and install Python 3.10 or 3.11 from python.org.

Important: During installation, check the box that says “Add Python to PATH.”

Install FFmpeg (Critical):
This is the "translator" the AI uses to read and write audio files.

Windows: Download FFmpeg and add it to your System PATH variables.

Mac: Open your terminal and run brew install ffmpeg.

Install Demucs & Dependencies:
Open your system terminal (Windows: cmd, Mac: Terminal) and run this specific command to avoid common errors:
pip install demucs soundfile==0.12.1 "torchaudio<2.5.0"

Note: If you get an error about "TorchCodec", running the command above will fix it.

Configure REAPER:
Open REAPER and go to Options > Preferences > Plug-ins > ReaScript.

Check the box “Enable Python for use in ReaScripts.”

If REAPER asks for the Python DLL path, it usually detects it automatically after restarting the program.

2. Script Installation
Download the file AI_Stem_Splitter_by_Oliver_Tkach.lua.

In REAPER:

Open the Action List by pressing the ? key (or go to Actions > Show action list).

Click the New action button (bottom right) and select Load ReaScript...

Find and select the downloaded .lua file.

3. Add the Command to the Right-Click Menu (Context Menu)
To make it easy to use, let’s add it to the menu that appears when you right-click an audio item:

Go to the top menu: Options > Customize menus/toolbars...

In the dropdown at the top left, select: Media item context

In the list on the left, scroll to the bottom.

Click Add... > Action...

Search for “AI_Stem_Splitter_by_Oliver_Tkach” in the list, select it, and click Select/Close.

(Optional) Right-click the newly added action and choose Rename to give it an epic name like: “SPLIT STEMS” or “AI STEM SPLITTER.”

IMPORTANT: Click the Save button (bottom right) to apply the changes.

4. How to Use It
Save your project first! (Especially on Mac to avoid permission errors).

Drag a song or audio clip into REAPER.

Right-click on the audio item.

Select your new option (e.g., SPLIT STEMS).

A black window (CMD) will open. Do not close it.

First time: It will download 2GB of AI models.

After that: Wait until it reaches 100% and closes automatically.

REAPER will automatically import the 6 aligned tracks, organized inside a folder.

🛡️ Security & Performance Notes
100% Private: The process is fully local. Your music is not uploaded to the internet.

Clean Workflow: The script uses your system’s temporary folder to avoid leaving unnecessary files on your hard drive.

GPU vs CPU: * NVIDIA Users: The script uses CUDA to process in seconds.

Others (Mac/AMD/Intel): It uses the CPU. It has the same professional quality but takes 3-7 minutes per song.

Mac Users: If you get a "Destination error", go to System Settings > Privacy > Full Disk Access and enable REAPER.

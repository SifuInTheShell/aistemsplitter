🚀 Tutorial: AI Stem Separation in REAPER
This tutorial will teach you how to split any song into 6 independent tracks (Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, and Other) directly inside REAPER, for free and locally.

1. Prerequisites (Only done once)
Before using the script, your computer needs to have the AI “engine” installed.
Install Python:
 Download and install the latest version from python.org.
 Important: During installation, check the box that says “Add Python to PATH.”
Install Demucs:
 Open your system terminal (press the Windows key, type cmd, and press Enter).
 Type the following command and press Enter:
pip install demucs

Configure REAPER:
Open REAPER and go to Options > Preferences > Plug-ins > ReaScript.


Check the box “Enable Python for use in ReaScripts.”


If REAPER asks for the Python DLL path, it usually detects it automatically after restarting the program.



2. Script Installation
Download the file AI_Stem_Splitter_by_Oliver_Tkach.lua.
In REAPER:
Open the Action List by pressing the ? key (or go to Actions > Show action list).


Click the New action button (bottom right) and select Load ReaScript...


Find and select the downloaded .lua file.


3. Add the Command to the Right-Click Menu (Context Menu)
To make it easy to use, let’s add it to the menu that appears when you right-click an audio item:
Go to the top menu: Options > Customize menus/toolbars...


In the dropdown at the top left, select: Media item context


In the list on the left, scroll to the bottom.


Click Add... > Action...


Search for “AI_Stem_Splitter_by_Oliver_Tkach” in the list, select it, and click Select/Close.


(Optional) Right-click the newly added action and choose Rename to give it an epic name like:
 “SPLIT STEMS” or “AI STEM SPLITTER.”


IMPORTANT: Click the Save button (bottom right) to apply the changes.



4. How to Use It
Drag a song or audio clip into REAPER.


Right-click on the audio item.


Select your new option (e.g., SPLIT STEMS).


A black window (CMD) will open. Do not close it. Wait until it reaches 100% and closes automatically.


REAPER will automatically import the 6 aligned tracks, organized inside a folder.



🛡️ Security Notes
100% Private: The process is fully local. Your music is not uploaded to the internet.
 Clean Workflow: The script uses your system’s temporary folder to avoid leaving unnecessary files on your hard drive.

# AI Stem Splitter by Oliver Tkach

A professional ReaScript for REAPER that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (Demucs) to separate audio into 6 high-fidelity tracks directly within your project.

## ✨ Features
- **6 Stems:** Separate audio into Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, and Other.
- **Privacy:** Processes everything locally on your PC; nothing is uploaded to the cloud.
- **Organization:** Automatically creates folders, names tracks, and aligns them to the original item's position.
- **Efficiency:** Uses system temporary directories to avoid permission errors and keep your project folder clean.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Before using the script, ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Python 3.10+**: Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). 
   * **Important:** During installation, check the box **"Add Python to PATH"**.
2. **Demucs**: Open your terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run:
   `pip install demucs`

## 🚀 Installation
1. **Download** the `.lua` file from this repository.
2. In **REAPER**, open the **Action List** (shortcut key `?`).
3. Click **New Action > Load ReaScript...** and select the downloaded file.
4. **(Optional)** To add it to your right-click menu: 
   Go to **Options > Customize menus/toolbars**, select **Media item context** from the dropdown, click **Add... > Action...**, find this script, and click **Save**.

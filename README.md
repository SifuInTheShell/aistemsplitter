AI Stem Splitter by Oliver Tkach
A professional ReaScript for REAPER that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (Demucs) to separate audio into 6 high-fidelity tracks directly within your project.

✨ Features
6 Stems: Separate audio into Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, and Other.

Privacy: Processes everything locally on your PC; nothing is uploaded to the cloud.

Organization: Automatically creates folders, names tracks, and aligns them to the original item's position.

Efficiency: Uses system temporary directories to avoid permission errors and keep your project folder clean.

🛠️ Requirements
Before using the script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.10+: Download it from python.org.

Important: During installation, check the box "Add Python to PATH".

FFmpeg: Essential for audio encoding.

Windows: Must be installed and added to your System PATH.

Mac: Install via Homebrew (brew install ffmpeg).

Libraries: Open your terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run this optimized command to avoid common errors:
pip install demucs soundfile==0.12.1 "torchaudio<2.5.0"

📌 IMPORTANT NOTES (PLEASE READ):

GPU vs CPU: You don't need an NVIDIA card to run this.

NVIDIA Users: The script will use CUDA and process songs in seconds.

Everyone else: The script will automatically use your CPU. It works perfectly and with the same high quality, but it will take longer (around 3-7 minutes per song). Just be patient while the AI does its magic!

The "TorchCodec" & Backend Fix: If you get a "RuntimeError" or "TorchCodec" error, ensure you installed the specific versions mentioned in the requirements above (soundfile and torchaudio).

First Run: The very first time you use the script, it will download the AI models (about 2GB). This only happens once!

🚀 Installation
Download the .lua file from this repository.

In REAPER, open the Action List (shortcut key ?).

Click New Action > Load ReaScript... and select the downloaded file.

(Optional) To add it to your right-click menu:
Go to Options > Customize menus/toolbars, select Media item context from the dropdown, click Add... > Action..., find this script, and click Save.

❓ FAQ
Q: Is it true that Demucs only works on Python 3.8 and is no longer available via pip?
A: No, that is a common misconception. Demucs is actively maintained and works perfectly on Python 3.10 and 3.11. The script is designed to call Python globally, making it compatible with any modern stable version.

Q: Why am I getting "command not found" or "pip is not recognized"?
A: This usually happens if Python was installed without checking the "Add Python to PATH" box. Without this, your computer doesn't know where to find Python or the Demucs library.

Q: How do I fix the installation easily?
A: Follow these steps to ensure a perfect setup:

Clean Start: Uninstall any old versions of Python.

Stable Version: Install Python 3.10.11 from python.org.

The "Secret" Step: During installation, you MUST check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".

Run these commands in your terminal (CMD) one by one:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

pip install demucs soundfile==0.12.1 "torchaudio<2.5.0"

Q: I get a "RuntimeError: Couldn't find appropriate backend" error.
A: This is fixed by installing the soundfile library. Run: pip install soundfile==0.12.1 and make sure FFmpeg is correctly installed in your system's PATH.

Q: What if I have permission errors when processing?
A: You don't have to worry about that. This script uses the system's TEMP folder and a custom Lua binary copy function to bypass Windows permission restrictions and handle special characters in file names automatically.
